After holding it hostage for basically 18 months, here's a song I finished in late 2018.

Enjoy :)

Lyrics:

Standing, waiting, running up and down we go<br>
Falling, dying, sitting in the shit, today<br>
Oh why? … Black Dog hangin’ round and round?

And on that day there was a day of expansions<br>
And in that time we thought of Tyleon<br>
But no… a formation of black and white

But it’s fine<br>
Ahhh<br>
Give it time<br>
Ahhh<br>
All was well<br>
Ahhh<br>
What the hell?<br>
Ahhh

She was there with it but she was in the stars<br>
It was easy for the thoughtless void within<br>
It was everything though meaning nothing here<br>
It was everything

But it’s fine<br>
Ahhh<br>
Give it time<br>
Ahhh<br>
All was well<br>
Ahhh<br>
What the hell?<br>
Ahhh
