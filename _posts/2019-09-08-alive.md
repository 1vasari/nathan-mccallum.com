I’ve been musically burnt out for maybe 8-10 months now.

It’s been a rough trip because music was my escape from everything but it doesn't have the same effect.
I just feel like I suck and that everything I do sounds bad.

Pretty much all of the music I do these days is random jamming.
This is one from a particular time this year when everything around me was quiet and it briefly felt good to play again...
