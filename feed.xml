Nothing super fancy.
It’s just so I can write what I’m thinking and feeling throughout the day.
Every so often I look back and think about whether I’m okay with how things are going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some issues came up and I ended up merging my journalling app functionality into another personal project.
The application code was really simple but of course the old entries needed to get moved across as well.
So the objective was the get the entries out of the old Postgres database and into a new one.
Along the way one column needed to be renamed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How hard can it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first tried to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin&quot;&gt;Rails Admin&lt;/a&gt; to export the entries.
Soon afterward, I discovered that it doesn’t have an import function.
So it was possible to download the entries but not import them into the new database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I tried to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pgadmin.org/&quot;&gt;pgAdmin&lt;/a&gt; to export the entries as some kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt; file and then import them into the new database.
Was I able to get this to work? Nope!
The import always failed because of something wrong with the date format in the source file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This stunt was made particularly difficult by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; hobby datastores, which appear to contain hundreds of databases pertaining to different Heroku user’s applications. Obviously your user can only access your own database table but the performance implications were fascinating. It looked like there were 50-100 reads occurring every second. This is why it’s free and also slow sometimes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what worked?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; file of the entires using Rails Admin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit the file to make the column changes that were required&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the file to a private Github Gist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run the following Ruby code in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails console&lt;/code&gt; of the destination app:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'json'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'net/http'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&amp;lt;Github Gist url here&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;PersonalLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'content'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'created_at'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;updated_at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'updated_at'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked but I’m convinced that there was a better way eluding me.&lt;/p&gt;

Though this was not mentioned on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955&quot;&gt;reported on&lt;/a&gt; fairly widely.
It reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23531032&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; wherein many discussions occurred.
Many response articles have been written, which are worth a read if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two questions at play: &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; should it be changed? and &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; should it be changed to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is fairly simple, just pick one. I would suggest one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;main&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; is the real source of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is anyone actually offended by this language?&lt;/em&gt; I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does this language actually carry the master/slave connotation that is being claimed?&lt;/em&gt; Many feel not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it easier to do nothing?&lt;/em&gt; Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reading from the discussions is that many are seeing the change of the default name as a signal that they now have to change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch on all of their existing repositories.
Which is a legitimate hassle.
Many are seeing this as a slippery slope - who can tell where it leads?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I think.
The programming community is diverse and it’s hard to know for certain whether terms are offensive (or even just &lt;em&gt;‘a little bit off’&lt;/em&gt;).
The database community has already had this discussion and the action taken was to rename &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slave&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;primary&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;replica&lt;/code&gt;.
If the term “master branch” has any semblance of the same dichotomy (which it can), then the best course is to change the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renaming the branch will break some tools.
It can be a pain in the ass.
But if this use of terminology is making the development work of anyone more difficult than it needs to be, then I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently contributed to a script for automatically making this change: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mheap/github-default-branch&quot;&gt;github-default-branch&lt;/a&gt;.
It can scan through your user account or organisation to rename &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (or any other name you specify) automatically.
It also updates references in Pull Requests, changes certain references in text files, and fixes branch protection rules.
I had this issue fixed for all of my repositories in an evening (including needing to fix a bug in the script).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for where this is going, all I can say is ‘somewhere’.
There were several references to Newspeak in the aforementioned discussions, which I find to be bland and ignorant.
Words fucking matter.
And they matter differently to different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that you can make references to Orwell and think you’re clever is flippant and misses the point of this discussion.
Which is that to create a system that is reasonably fair, reasonably safe, and reasonably usable, you must be willing to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recording for this song began in early 2018.
I was starting out as a music student at QUT and was keen to be working on new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular song came chorus first.
Sometime in 2017 I was playing piano with a friend on bass and I stumbled across what became the main vocal line of the chorus.
The friend and I jammed on it for a while and then I recorded it as a voice memo on my phone.
I later found the recording and decided to sing it and fill the spaces with harmonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had no idea where the song was coming from or going.
So that was the next challenge.
Fill out the rest of the song, taking it from a glorified chorus to a whole statement of its own.
I continued reaching into the past through my voice memos and found a recording of my school’s bell sound.
I used this to make the intro melody that you hear while all the ambient effects were building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this added up to an almost complete song, comprising an intro, chorus, chord progression, and harmonies.
What remained was to come up with a verse and then work out the final structure.
I came up with a verse melody and ultimately decided on a structure of intro, verse, chorus, solo, verse, chorus, solo, outtro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this state the song remained for a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to April 2018, my family went away for a week and I stayed home to have some time to work.
During this week I did the solos, lyrics, lead vocal and filmed the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/a-public-void/ableton.png&quot; alt=&quot;The finished Ableton session&quot; width=&quot;2682&quot; height=&quot;1972&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solos were improvised.
It took a few takes to get them right but otherwise nothing complex.
I wrote the lyrics in the late afternoon and then did the vocals that evening.
The lyrics have shadows of meaning but generally I was being silly with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only important lyric is the ‘public void’ bit (also the song title, in case you were unaware).
The first real programming project I attempted was an Android app, using the Java programming language.
All Java programs begin with something called the main function, which looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MyJavaProgram&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the public void in there? It’s like the beginning of something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In filming the video I learnt a lot.
This was my first time filming video with a DSLR camera as well as my first time editing ‘multicam’ footage.
Overall I think it looks good, except for the solos.
As mentioned above, the solos were improvised, which meant that I didn’t know exactly how to play them.
I ended up miming along to the recording and it’s just not convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/a-public-void/timeline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The edit line of the project&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;1278&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My computer at the time wasn’t very powerful so I decided to edit the video on one of QUT’s computers.
A friend of mine was over one night and as they were leaving I asked if they could drop me off at the train station.
This was at about 9:30pm and of course when I got there I realized I didn’t have my wallet.
No train pass or money for tickets.
I didn’t want to be a bother, so I decided to try and fix this myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It went well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sped walked home (40 minutes).
Changed my clothes, repacked my stuff, double checked the dogs, and rode my bike back to the station.
I was tired from the walk, unfit, hungry, and struggling with the hills to get to the station.
A recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was within sight of the station both my calves cramped up and I fell pretty badly.
I don’t remember being in a lot of pain in that moment but I did stay lying on the ground for a long time.
“What the fuck am I doing?” I wondered.
Eventually I got up, checked myself (including the computer in my backpack and the DSLR - more concerned about my devices than my body), and limped to the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the train, found a bus to get to Kelvin Grove (it was the last one for the night, otherwise I would have had to walk another kilometre or two) and finally made it.
I cooked some left over noodles I’d brought and grabbed a Coke from the vending machine.
University diets are truly the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it was 1am.
It took a while for me to get the multicam stuff right but after three hours I was happy that it was okay.
Uploaded at about 4:30am.&lt;/p&gt;

COVID-19 is happening and it’s bad.
Many are sick, many have lost their lives. Many are scared.
We are seeing tremendous unity whilst also being at our most isolated.
Stories of triumph and survival immediately followed by news of more storms.
The future cost to us mentally, economically and socially is yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been inside for over a month now, with the only trips out being to get coffee or groceries.
It’s scary to read the news and see what everyone is going through.
Here in Queensland, Australia, we’re lucky to have few cases and already daily new cases are dropping.
Others all over the world are sadly not so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our essential workers, medical professionals, leaders (and too many others to name) this is a time to dig deep.
For the rest of us, we just need to stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of chatter about what to do during isolation.
Suggestions abound and none of what I’ve seen is particularity bad.
&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, while it is true that some of us have more time than we used to, I think it’s far from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parents, now needing to babysit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who have moved to working from home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are unemployed, now looking for work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are caring for others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are still learning (school or university)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are grieving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re now at home with nothing to do, you are lucky.
And if you feel motivated enough to improve yourself in some way, I implore you to do so!
But not at the cost of your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to overestimate yourself.
Have you ever set a new year’s resolution and then not stuck to it?
Of course you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re facing a similar issue now.
At any given time, it’s easy to assemble a list of things you can improve about yourself.
But it’s overwhelming to try and action everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be gentle on yourself and others.
Do what you can to make things better.
You don’t have to change the world right now.
You just have to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to set reasonable goals for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan McCallum</name></author><category term="musings" /><summary type="html">I don’t need to cover the story so far.

I’d already heard a lot of the classics so we don’t need to go there, but &lt;em&gt;Le Noise&lt;/em&gt; got my attention because it’s pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instrumentation for the whole album is deceptively simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neil’s voice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acoustic guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A handful of synthesizers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Black&quot;&gt;Old Black&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-walk-with-me&quot;&gt;1. Walk With Me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XUGej_ofcAQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt; opens the album, introducing the distorted guitar sound and heavily delayed vocals that we hear through most of the album.
The song itself is fairly simple, Neil’s vocals sounding as good as ever.
The thing that made the song for me however was the lovely ambient electronic breakdown at the end.
As if to give us a peep into some other world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-love-and-war&quot;&gt;2. Love and War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/skJddbSJQjA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth track on the album and we finally get a different texture, acoustic guitar and voice.
On first listening it felt like a long time coming, but well worth it.
The song is a wonderful ballad, mournful but somewhat hopeful.
Admitting a lack of knowledge, despite seeing a lot. Hoping for things to be better, know that they may not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the nice touches with the harmony through the piece.
The verses are in A minor and choruses in G, with some interesting interplay between the two.
Particularity the usage of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;D7&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;) resolving to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Am&lt;/code&gt; instead.
Music theorists would call this a deceptive resolution but to me it just feels like we’re going back down into the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-peaceful-valley-boulevard&quot;&gt;3. Peaceful Valley Boulevard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/4UffjWGMiBQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely, mournful, really nice song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning this it took me quite a while to realize what was going on in the chorus.
At first I thought it was an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ebm7b5&lt;/code&gt; and was trying to find a voicing that matched what I was hearing.
In the end I worked out that it was actually an even more dissonant &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ebdim7&lt;/code&gt; chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the break to F major took me right back to &lt;em&gt;Starman&lt;/em&gt; by David Bowie.
It only goes for 30 seconds but the effect was immense.
And the deceptive resolution (there’s the term again!) back to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Em&lt;/code&gt; felt like it all just died and faded away into memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-i-didnt-like&quot;&gt;Things I didn’t like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no drums! This is great in the acoustic songs but there were moments in the electric tracks where I just wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after hearing &lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt; I felt like &lt;em&gt;Sign of Love&lt;/em&gt; was a bit plain.
This was followed by &lt;em&gt;Someone’s Gonna Rescue You&lt;/em&gt; and it took me a while to shake the feeling of &lt;em&gt;“Is the whole album like this?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in fact that’s the main gripe I have: except for &lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt;, the electric tracks all feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the years I’ve run several different &lt;em&gt;“Hello, World - this is me”&lt;/em&gt;-type sites and nothing has quite stuck.
Given the vast array of options, I’ve never settled on any one thing.
I can at least remember trying Wordpress, Ghost, SquareSpace, as well as various things I’ve hacked together and hosted on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current iteration is a Jekyll site hosted for free on GitHub Pages.
And I think it’s going to work.
Why?
Because I changed my expectation.
I realized I was chasing a “perfect” option when instead I just needed to find “my” option.
I’m even using the default Jekyll theme right now.
Because it doesn’t actually matter.
I’ve seen many (more successful) blogs that look worse than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pondering recently why I am resistant to change.
My thoughts so far have been that when I am presented with a new situation, I see an infinity of possibilities, or none at all.
For instance, I often look at an empty Ableton Live session and feel that I could make any music I want.
But I do nothing because I can’t find &lt;strong&gt;the thing&lt;/strong&gt; (musical, lyrical, emotional, or otherwise) that I’m trying to express.
In 2016 I tried to start a blog, but never wrote a single post because I felt like I had nothing at all to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of a quote from Winston Churchill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there’s a middle ground between the two extremes of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;?
A state where one can keep moving without losing track of what’s important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s too many possibilities, reduce them down until you’re left with one.
If you have no possibilities, do something stupid until something comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of my personal blog, it doesn’t actually really matter whether I use SquareSpace, Ghost, or something I hacked together.
I’ve been enjoying my Rails work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegrantshub.com&quot;&gt;The Grants Hub&lt;/a&gt; so I chose a Ruby-based static site generator.
But it could have been anything.
The point was that I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of my music, I’ve found that I can get better results by writing guitar parts instead of getting stuck in the details of synthesizer design, mixing or drum programming.
I can then swap the guitars with other sounds or get other people to play the parts, all of which can potentially serve the music better.
However I wouldn’t have gotten there had I not gone back and reduced the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we’re experiencing a pandemic of unprecedented scale.
On social media I’m seeing many posts saying “use the isolation time to learn new skills”.
I don’t buy it though. I feel like I’ve got enough going on with reading, music and work.
But perhaps this is another instance of me seeing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan McCallum</name></author><category term="musings" /><summary type="html">It is a cool Sunday evening and I am once again experimenting with my personal site.
