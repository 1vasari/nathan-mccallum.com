COVID-19 is happening and it’s bad.&lt;!--more--&gt;
Many are sick, many have lost their lives. Many are scared.
We are seeing tremendous unity whilst also being at our most isolated.
Stories of triumph and survival immediately followed by news of more storms.
The future cost to us mentally, economically and socially is yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now been inside for over a month now, with the only trips out being to get coffee or groceries.
It’s scary to read the news and see what everyone is going through.
Here in Queensland, Australia, we’re lucky to have few cases and already daily new cases are dropping.
Others all over the world are sadly not so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our essential workers, medical professionals, leaders (and too many others to name) this is a time to dig deep.
For the rest of us, we just need to stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of chatter about what to do during isolation.
Suggestions abound and none of what I’ve seen is particularity bad.
&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, while it is true that some of us have more time than we used to, I think it’s far from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parents, now needing to babysit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who have moved to working from home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are unemployed, now looking for work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are caring for others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are still learning (school or university)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who are grieving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re now at home with nothing to do, you are lucky.
And if you feel motivated enough to improve yourself in some way, I implore you to do so!
But not at the cost of your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to overestimate yourself.
Have you ever set a new year’s resolution and then not stuck to it?
Of course you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re facing a similar issue now.
At any given time, it’s easy to assemble a list of things you can improve about yourself.
But it’s overwhelming to try and action everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be gentle on yourself and others.
Do what you can to make things better.
You don’t have to change the world right now.
You just have to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to set reasonable goals for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan McCallum</name></author><category term="musings" /><summary type="html">I don’t need to cover the story so far.

I’d already heard a lot of the classics so we don’t need to go there, but &lt;em&gt;Le Noise&lt;/em&gt; got my attention because it’s pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instrumentation for the whole album is deceptively simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neil’s voice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acoustic guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A handful of synthesizers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Black&quot;&gt;Old Black&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-walk-with-me&quot;&gt;1. Walk With Me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/XUGej_ofcAQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt; opens the album, introducing the distorted guitar sound and heavily delayed vocals that we hear through most of the album.
The song itself is fairly simple, Neil’s vocals sounding as good as ever.
The thing that made the song for me however was the lovely ambient electronic breakdown at the end.
As if to give us a peep into some other world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-love-and-war&quot;&gt;2. Love and War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/skJddbSJQjA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth track on the album and we finally get a different texture, acoustic guitar and voice.
On first listening it felt like a long time coming, but well worth it.
The song is a wonderful ballad, mournful but somewhat hopeful.
Admitting a lack of knowledge, despite seeing a lot. Hoping for things to be better, know that they may not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the nice touches with the harmony through the piece.
The verses are in A minor and choruses in G, with some interesting interplay between the two.
Particularity the usage of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;D7&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;) resolving to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Am&lt;/code&gt; instead.
Music theorists would call this a deceptive resolution but to me it just feels like we’re going back down into the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-peaceful-valley-boulevard&quot;&gt;3. Peaceful Valley Boulevard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/4UffjWGMiBQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely, mournful, really nice song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning this it took me quite a while to realize what was going on in the chorus.
At first I thought it was an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ebm7b5&lt;/code&gt; and was trying to find a voicing that matched what I was hearing.
In the end I worked out that it was actually an even more dissonant &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ebdim7&lt;/code&gt; chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the break to F major took me right back to &lt;em&gt;Starman&lt;/em&gt; by David Bowie.
It only goes for 30 seconds but the effect was immense.
And the deceptive resolution (there’s the term again!) back to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Em&lt;/code&gt; felt like it all just died and faded away into memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-i-didnt-like&quot;&gt;Things I didn’t like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no drums! This is great in the acoustic songs but there were moments in the electric tracks where I just wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after hearing &lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt; I felt like &lt;em&gt;Sign of Love&lt;/em&gt; was a bit plain.
This was followed by &lt;em&gt;Someone’s Gonna Rescue You&lt;/em&gt; and it took me a while to shake the feeling of &lt;em&gt;“Is the whole album like this?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in fact that’s the main gripe I have: except for &lt;em&gt;Walk With Me&lt;/em&gt;, the electric tracks all feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My overall rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 6/10&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan McCallum</name></author><category term="album-reviews" /><summary type="html">Recently I’ve been reading Waging Heavy Pace (Neil Young’s autobiography) and a natural part of such a process is to listen to the music that’s mentioned along the way.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting Started</title><link href="http://nathan-mccallum.com/2020/04/05/getting-started.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Started" /><published>2020-04-05T18:19:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-04-05T18:19:00+10:00</updated><id>http://nathan-mccallum.com/2020/04/05/getting-started</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://nathan-mccallum.com/2020/04/05/getting-started.html">&lt;p&gt;It is a cool Sunday evening and I am once again experimenting with my personal site.
Over the years I’ve run several different &lt;em&gt;“Hello, World - this is me”&lt;/em&gt;-type sites and nothing has quite stuck.&lt;!--more--&gt;
Given the vast array of options, I’ve never settled on any one thing.
I can at least remember trying Wordpress, Ghost, SquareSpace, as well as various things I’ve hacked together and hosted on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This current iteration is a Jekyll site hosted for free on GitHub Pages.
And I think it’s going to work.
Why?
Because I changed my expectation.
I realized I was chasing a “perfect” option when instead I just needed to find “my” option.
I’m even using the default Jekyll theme right now.
Because it doesn’t actually matter.
I’ve seen many (more successful) blogs that look worse than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pondering recently why I am resistant to change.
My thoughts so far have been that when I am presented with a new situation, I see an infinity of possibilities, or none at all.
For instance, I often look at an empty Ableton Live session and feel that I could make any music I want.
But I do nothing because I can’t find &lt;strong&gt;the thing&lt;/strong&gt; (musical, lyrical, emotional, or otherwise) that I’m trying to express.
In 2016 I tried to start a blog, but never wrote a single post because I felt like I had nothing at all to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of a quote from Winston Churchill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there’s a middle ground between the two extremes of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;?
A state where one can keep moving without losing track of what’s important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s too many possibilities, reduce them down until you’re left with one.
If you have no possibilities, do something stupid until something comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of my personal blog, it doesn’t actually really matter whether I use SquareSpace, Ghost, or something I hacked together.
I’ve been enjoying my Rails work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegrantshub.com&quot;&gt;The Grants Hub&lt;/a&gt; so I chose a Ruby-based static site generator.
But it could have been anything.
The point was that I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of my music, I’ve found that I can get better results by writing guitar parts instead of getting stuck in the details of synthesizer design, mixing or drum programming.
I can then swap the guitars with other sounds or get other people to play the parts, all of which can potentially serve the music better.
However I wouldn’t have gotten there had I not gone back and reduced the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we’re experiencing a pandemic of unprecedented scale.
On social media I’m seeing many posts saying “use the isolation time to learn new skills”.
I don’t buy it though. I feel like I’ve got enough going on with reading, music and work.
But perhaps this is another instance of me seeing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nathan McCallum</name></author><category term="musings" /><summary type="html">It is a cool Sunday evening and I am once again experimenting with my personal site.
