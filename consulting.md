I am available for consulting through my sole trader *"1vasari arts & media"* either remotely or on site in Brisbane, Australia.
You can see my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/1vasari) and some of my projects [here](/projects/).

I can help you build your next:

- Website
- Ruby on Rails app
- PHP site
- React or Vue frontend
- Node.js backend
- Mobile app

I have experience with the MySQL and MongoDB databases as well as extensive experience maintaning legacy code.

I can reduce your technical debt, rescue an old system, or start a brand new one.

I speak English and have the right to work in Australia.

If you're interested, please reach out to me via [hey@nathan-mccallum.com](mailto:hey@nathan-mccallum.com).
