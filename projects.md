The Lacuna Expanse is a region of space with millions of habitable worlds. You can play with or compete against thousands of players as you build your empire, fight off spies in a battle for cold war supremacy, form alliances, search the expanse for lost ancient artifacts, and more.

My work on TLE was centered around the web client.
Originally it was built with YUI2 however I introduced React and unidirectional state management.
I also redesigned and implemented the new main UI for the game.
