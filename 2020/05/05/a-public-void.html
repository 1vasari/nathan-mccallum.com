<p>The recording for this song began in early 2018.
I was starting out as a music student at QUT and was keen to be working on new music.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This particular song came chorus first.
Sometime in 2017 I was playing piano with a friend on bass and I stumbled across what became the main vocal line of the chorus.
The friend and I jammed on it for a while and then I recorded it as a voice memo on my phone.
I later found the recording and decided to sing it and fill the spaces with harmonies.</p>

<p>At this point I had no idea where the song was coming from or going.
So that was the next challenge.
Fill out the rest of the song, taking it from a glorified chorus to a whole statement of its own.
I continued reaching into the past through my voice memos and found a recording of my school’s bell sound.
I used this to make the intro melody that you hear while all the ambient effects were building up.</p>

<p>All of this added up to an almost complete song, comprising an intro, chorus, chord progression, and harmonies.
What remained was to come up with a verse and then work out the final structure.
I came up with a verse melody and ultimately decided on a structure of intro, verse, chorus, solo, verse, chorus, solo, outtro.</p>

<p>In this state the song remained for a month or two.</p>

<p>Fast forward to April 2018, my family went away for a week and I stayed home to have some time to work.
During this week I did the solos, lyrics, lead vocal and filmed the video.</p>

<p>The solos were improvised.
It took a few takes to get them right but otherwise nothing complex.
I wrote the lyrics in the late afternoon and then did the vocals that evening.
The lyrics have shadows of meaning but generally I was being silly with them.</p>

<p>I think the only important lyric is the ‘public void’ bit (also the song title, in case you were unaware).
The first real programming project I attempted was an Android app, using the Java programming language.
All Java programs begin with something called the main function, which looks like the following:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">MyJavaProgram</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="nc">Hello</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">World</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the public void in there? It’s like the beginning of something new.</p>

<p>In filming the video I learnt a lot.
This was my first time filming video with a DSLR camera as well as my first time editing ‘multicam’ footage.
Overall I think it looks good, except for the solos.
As mentioned above, the solos were improvised, which meant that I didn’t know exactly how to play them.
I ended up miming along to the recording and it’s just not convincing.</p>

<p>One more thing.</p>

<p>My computer at the time wasn’t very powerful so I decided to edit the video on one of QUT’s computers.
A friend of mine was over one night and as they were leaving I asked if they could drop me off at the train station.
This was at about 9:30pm and of course when I got there I realized I didn’t have my wallet.
No train pass or money for tickets.
I didn’t want to be a bother, so I decided to try and fix this myself.</p>

<p><em>It went well.</em></p>

<p>I sped walked home (40 minutes).
Changed my clothes, repacked my stuff, double checked the dogs, and rode my bike back to the station.
I was tired from the walk, unfit, hungry, and struggling with the hills to get to the station.
A recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>When I was within sight of the station both my calves cramped up and I fell pretty badly.
I don’t remember being in a lot of pain in that moment but I did stay lying on the ground for a long time.
“What the fuck am I doing?” I wondered.
Eventually I got up, checked myself (including the computer in my backpack and the DSLR - more concerned about my devices than my body), and limped to the station.</p>

<p>I got to the train, found a bus to get to Kelvin Grove (it was the last one for the night, otherwise I would have had to walk another kilometre or two) and finally made it.
I cooked some left over noodles I’d brought and grabbed a Coke from the vending machine.
University diets are truly the best.</p>

<p>At this point it was 1am.
It took a while for me to get the multicam stuff right but after three hours I was happy that it was okay.
Uploaded at about 4:30am.</p>

<p>I then laid on the floor till the sun came up.</p>
